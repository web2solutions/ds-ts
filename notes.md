1) Data Structures - Practice data structures like Heaps, HashTable, Tree, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and Graph. 
2) Algorithm - Practice recursion, Merge-Sort, Quick-Sort, Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Divide and Conquer, and Dynamic Programming
3) Explain your thought process - Extremely important. Practice describing your solution and design decisions clearly and concisely.
4) Collaborate – Don't forget to discuss, present multiple solutions, and take hints from the interviewer.
